# they.me.uk

they.me.uk is a very basic Bootstrap static site that debunks myths surrounding use of the gender-neutral singular 'they' pronoun. 

It's now built into a docker container for easy deploy, but if you want to run it on more traditional hosting, just (S)FTP the files in the `codebase/` directory to the server.

Official version is currently hosted at https://they.witchpersonalityis.me
